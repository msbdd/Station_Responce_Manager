# Seismic Response Manager

**Seismic Response Manager** is a user-friendly tool for viewing, editing, and managing seismic station metadata in both [FDSN StationXML](https://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/) and [dataless SEED](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/dataless-seed/) formats.

This project is inspired by the [IRIS PDCC (Portable Data Collection Center)](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/pdcc/), aiming to provide a modern, intuitive alternative for network operators, researchers, and data managers.  
While the Java version of PDCC still works, I have experienced crashes, lack of support for custom `.RESP` files (crashed while trying to load a valid file that could be loaded in [ObsPy](https://docs.obspy.org/)), and missing StationXML support.

StationXML is a great format for managing station metadata â€” but editing it manually in a text editor isn't always comfortable for users.  

**Seismic Response Manager** is designed for usability, making common tasks easier, safer, and more convenient.

Currently trying to create a first MVP that could be used.
